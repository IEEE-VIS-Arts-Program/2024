  <div class="visap_abstract">
    <p>In the video series 'Biological Rhythms', electrical signals generated
by plants are sonified and captured to drive real-time data visualisations.
From this live data, we will create a series of eight video pieces (see
links to draft versions of the first four in 'Recent work, video links'
section below). Living plants and the human body may appear to be very
different entities, but they have many underlying confluences. Once such
confluence is that both generate bio-electrical signals that pass
through bodily systems. In 'Biological Rhythms' we will use these
signals to generate real time visualisations, revealing the unseen
bioelectrical rhythms of plants. Through the biological sciences, we
understand plant meta- processes such as osmosis and photosynthesis, yet
because their cellular structure is so delicate, plants are notoriously
hard to study in fine detail. Sonifying plant signals affords a method
to explore their bio-rhythms in an accessible form for a non-scientific
audience. As part of our bespoke and innovative method, the electrical
signals from plants are converted to audio and passed through the
program Touch Designer, where the plant signals activate complex
geometrical forms. Simon Howden composes 'human' music which is mixed
live with the plant signals, allowing us to explore co-creation with
living plants as a posthuman mode of artistic research.</p>

    <p>Abstract: Curbside is a personal exploration of (dis)ability and
(im)mobility in wintertime Calgary. I use textiles, texts, and
photographs to weave together self and the environment. Curbside
connects quantitative data about snow and temperature with traces of
environmental conditions using dyed yarns and photographs. Interlaced
throughout are theoretically grounded autobiographical reflections about
disability. These reflections focus on how landscape forms and interacts
with disability in ways that are informed by water, snow, and ice. It
embodies how different forms of data such as quantitative weather data,
material traces, and personal stories can work together. Curbside also
provides an example of how data art can incorporate highly personal
experience to illuminate local systems in thoughtful ways.</p>

    <p>Self-tracking data may be the most massive and pervasive type of data,
often in a format not usually recognized as such: photos. Digital
photography allows us to keep a record of where we have been, what we
have seen, and, most importantly, how we have felt. Photos achieve this
because they are their own visualization — organic and full of
detail — retaining impressions that we also hold in our memories. It is
through the excessive richness of images that a direct and intimate
connection to each of us is created.</p>
<p>When we speak of image data, we usually refer to the meta-information
(time, location) and content that can be extracted from it (what can be
objectively identified within the image), thus obscuring the organic
nature that gives it its auratic quality. Paradoxically, it is only by
considering the digital image as a technical object — a matrix of RGB
values — that its material plasticity is brought back to our awareness,
and its auratic quality is retrieved.</p>
<p>Mosaic Memory Drive is a puzzle of self-tracked memories. It reproduces
an image by using the pieces of another in an endless loop of re- and
de-construction. It is a series of anagrams — or anagraphs: permutations
of pixels — where an &quot;original&quot; data is present only as the
rearranging tiles that lend themselves to another, challenging
assumptions about the information actually stored in our data and
ourselves.</p>
<p>For this process to be accurately displayed, it needs to be run in
real-time, as video encryption dissolves the images' materiality to
make files lighter and their progressive decryption faster. Mosaic
Memory Drive is thus a process of encryption and decryption itself. The
technique can also be used to encode space-filling and pixel-based
visualizations into images, supporting the creation of novel data-driven
narratives.</p>

    <p>Rage Against the Archive is an artivist project comprising video,
performance, and new media art that scrutinizes how the New York Public
Library's (NYPL) digital archives catalog, display and even sell
dehumanizing ethnographic images from colonial India. This work
critically probes whether institutional archives perpetuate the cycle of
colonial trauma and the camera's violence. My conceptual approach is
anchored in a critical paradigm intended to underscore how technology
still commodifies the bodies of people of color, and how we, as a more
conscientious society, should consume certain historically traumatic
images online.</p>
<p>The People of India, published between 1868-75, is one of the world's
oldest and most comprehensive ethnographic books, commissioned by the
British colonial government in India after the 1857 First War of
Independence. After experiencing violent uprisings and the first
challenge to their colonial rule, the Britishers were keen to understand
the native tribes and their cultures to rule them better and prevent
future rebellions. The camera, masquerading as an objective device for
data collection, was employed as an imperial tool to document the
natives, &quot;othering&quot; them. Dehumanizing ethnographic portraits were used
as data points with an agenda to push forward a pseudo-scientific theory
about the racial, economic and cultural inferiority of Indians to
justify colonial rule. How does this problematic historical data exist
in our contemporary institutional archives? For this project, I explored
NYPL's online archives, which digitized the original book, providing
the public free access to these ethnographic images. However, NYPL's
website also sells these images of suffering as &quot;Fine Art Prints&quot; in
various options. Infusing archival practices with capitalism raises some
critical questions.</p>
<p>In my experimental browser-based video, I use Google Chrome's &quot;Inspect
Element&quot; feature as a glitch resistance tool to modify the underlying
HTML code of NYPL's website, inserting texts in the website that resist
the colonial ideology and question the fixity of memory present in the
archive. I also developed a Chrome browser extension that subverts
NYPL's website and replaces all the &quot;Buy as Art Print&quot; options with an
error message in an act of Electronic Civil Disobedience. With these
symbolic digital gestures, I hope to restore some dignity to my
ancestors, who have not only been exploited before by colonial
photographers, but whose visual representations are also being
commodified today by NYPL. In my project, I use web technologies to
challenge and disrupt entrenched power structures and propose a
decolonized digital archive where technology is harnessed to foster
respect and care. I believe that digital archives, in some cases,
instead of being harbingers of free knowledge, are just another way to
amplify the camera's violence, and they must be raged against.</p>

    <p>This artwork was born of witnessing my grandmother's memory regression
due to dementia, where her cherished stories dissolved into fragmented
words. Dr. Mary Steedly once described memories as a &quot;densely layered,
sometimes conflictual negotiation with the passage of time&quot;, and in
2022, over 50 million people faced this painful reality of memory loss
due to Alzheimer's and related dementias. Yet, amidst this poignant
backdrop, the emergence of text-to-image AI systems in 2022 offered a
glimmer of new perspective, as they harnessed the power of language to
imagine and reassemble fragmented memories, possibly to weave what time
and disease had stolen.</p>
<p>When we coexist with machines, will we accumulate synthetic
recollections of collective symbiotic imagination? Is language capable
of re-weaving and synthesizing memories? How does our collective memory
inspire new visual forms and alternative narratives?</p>
<p>Recollection is an assemblage of intimate human-machine artifacts that
emphasizes the contributions from three sides: artists, machines, and
participants. This customized AI application facilitates multiple AI
techniques, like speech recognition, text auto-completion, and
text-to-image, to convert language input into image sequences of new
memories. As an interactive experience, participants will whisper their
personal memories with fragmented sentences, and our system will
automatically fill in details, creating new touching visual memories.</p>
<p>We developed our customized AI system by fine-tuning a pre-trained
transformer-based AI model to learn the documentaries of Alzheimer
patients' visual memories and their descriptions. The system imagines
new memories of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;loss&quot; by interpreting real-time
narratives from participants in the installation. Our system emerges as
a vibrant and inclusive conversation starter, transcending boundaries
with support for over 89 different languages, embracing the diverse
cultural artifacts.</p>
<p>In the art installation, we chose not to showcase the direct visual
output generated by our AI system. Instead, we drew inspiration from
fine-art practices such as the Monotype, a printmaking technique tracing
its origins to the 1640s, and slitscan photography, known for capturing
sequential slices of a subject over time. We aimed to present
ReCollection by combining generative methodologies with fine-art
practices, investigating new aesthetics that explore the fleeting visual
imagery, undergoing dissolution, tilting, printing, and reprinting over
time.</p>
<p>By providing a conceptual framework for non-linear narratives, which
constitute symbiotic imaginations, and future scenarios of memories,
culture production, and reproductions. It may inspire the cure for
memory regression by providing a future scenario, a thought experiment,
and an intimate recollection of symbiosis between beings and apparatus.
It raises people's awareness of future memory preservation and their
empathy for the dementia community through a personalized aesthetic
experience. It offers an artistic approach and future prototype for
cultural heritage reproduction and re-imagination and explores the
tensions that exist in the co-relations between visual representations,
language, and narratives.</p>

    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly prevalent in
everyday life and across various sectors, notably intelligent
assistants, healthcare, and education. In the realm of human-computer
interaction, AI interactive systems aim to foster connections and
understanding among users further, deepening the communication between
humans and machines as well as among multiple individuals. However, this
paper highlights that current studies have neglected the media and
philosophical dimensions, culminating in an interactive system named the
'Humanity Test.' &quot;Humanity&quot; refers to emotions and consciousness,
while &quot;test&quot; signifies a critical study of AI technology and an
exploration of the distinctions between humanity and technicality.
Furthermore, based on a review of related literature, we argue that the
focus of AI system research is shifting, with electroencephalogram (EEG)
data becoming a trend in AI system integration. Collecting and analyzing
experimental data, we identified three design directions: enhancing
immersive experiences, creating emotional experiences, and expressing
ideas. The experiment results indicate that integrating EEG data into AI
systems markedly improves participants' immersive and emotional
experiences. This integration not only promotes a deeper understanding
of the human-machine boundary but also encourages empathic interactions
among users. Based on these findings, EEG data as a medium shows a
promising potential to enrich interactive experiences, providing new

representations to communicate the science on which society rests and on
which society must act. However, current visualization techniques often
lack the broad visual vocabulary needed to accommodate the explosion in
data scale, diversity and audience perspectives.
While previous work has mined artistic and design knowledge for colour
maps and shape affordances (glyphs) in visualization, line encoding has
received little attention. In this paper we report on an exploration of
visual properties that extend the vocabulary of the line, particularly
for categorical encoding. We describe the creation of a corpus of lines
motivated by artistic practice, gestalt theory and design principles and
present initial results from a study of how different visual properties
influence how people associate these into sets of similar lines. While
very preliminary, the findings suggest a rich set of line visual
features to support both association and categorical hierarchies, and
provoke further inquiry into how and why line encoding can be more
expressive encoding multivariate, multidimensional data.</p>

three-dimensional typographic sculptures, a touch screen and projection,
the work allows the public to visualize and locate the servers of the
one hundred most accessed websites in Brazil. This installation is part
of research in artistic data visualization that addresses issues of the
data infrastructure sustaining our society, highlighting the Global
North's dominance in data flows. &quot;Northness&quot; was featured in the
exhibition &quot;Numerical Existence: Emergencies,&quot; which took place in 2024
at the Futuros Cultural Center in Brazil.</p>

    <p>In the face of pressing global issues like climate change, data
visualization is a powerful tool for making sense of complexity. With
the project &quot;A Perfect Storm&quot;, we aim to engage audiences in the
oft-difficult conversation around global climate change in a way that
considers the emotional responses that the topic can trigger. Through a
metaphorical approach of visually juxtaposing countries' climate risk
with their climate responsibility, we encourage critical reflection on
the human experience and inequities of climate change related loss.</p>

    <p>Metro systems are the pulsing veins of cities, traversing the city's
texture and preserving the memory of urban life. Visualizing invisible
urban metro landscape makes each city's unique identity and development
more emblematic. In this project, we introduce an abstraction method
that encodes metro routes as lines, cities as squares, and the global
map as an abstract representation. Along with the implementation of an
interactive system, the project enables a comprehensive visual
exploration of the global metro lines. Through this highly abstract and
minimalist form, each city's structure, symbolic identity, and regional
development are revealed. Moreover, the colorful global metro map
efficiently portrays the diversity and evolution of metro lines
worldwide. With this pictorial we narrate the design process and our
reflections along the project.</p>

    <p>This pictorial illustrates an autoethnographic exploration of my design
practice for the data physicalization &quot;Shredded Lives: A Decade of
Migrant Loss&quot;. It emphasizes the parallel development of seven design
components — Interaction Mode, Technology, Data Representation,
Physical Configuration &amp; Scale, Dataset, Engagement Mode, and Spatial
Experience. This flexible, non-hierarchical approach allows each
component to inform and evolve alongside the others, stemming from a
desire to thoroughly explore the design space without confinement by
initial restrictions. As these components overlap and intersect, dynamic
interactions occur, leading to the manifestation of design ideas.</p>

    <p>This article introduces an artistic research project that utilises
artist-in-residency and exhibition as methods for exploring the
possibilities of robotic 3D printing and ceramics. The interdisciplinary
project unites artists and architects to collaborate on a proposed
curatorial concept and Do-It-With-Others (DIWO) technological
development. Constraints include material, specifically local clay,
production technique, namely 3D printing with a robotic arm, and kiln
size, as well as an exhibition concept that is further elaborated in the
next chapter. The pictorial presents four projects as case studies
demonstrating how the creatives integrate these constraints into their
processes. This integration leads to the subsequent refinement and
customization of the robotic-ceramics interface, aligning with the
practitioners' requirements through software development. The
project's focus extends beyond artistic outcomes, aiming also to
advance the pipeline of 3D robotic printing in clay, employing a
digitally controlled material press that has been developed in-house,
with its functionality refined through practice.</p>

    <p>With armed conflicts and wars continuing to occur globally, peace has
been an enduring and crucial concern. In the efforts to resolve these
conflicts, a vast number of peace agreements have been signed. In this
project, we examine the extent to which women and gender are explicitly
acknowledged or addressed in peace agreements. Using debossing, we
physicalize the mentions of women and gender in these agreements as a
means to increase awareness and recognition of these suffered but
often-overlooked crowds.</p>
