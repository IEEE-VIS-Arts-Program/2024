# VISAP Keynote: The Golden Age of Visualization Dissensus

Historians of visualization often say that the 19th century was a Golden Age of the craft, as it was the time when much of the syntax and vocabulary that we use to this day were developed. This talk will propose to make the 21st century a Golden Age of dissensus in visualization, a rebellion against popular and overarching rules, norms, conventions, and historical myths that should be deeply scrutinized and then either reframed—if their usefulness is corroborated—or discarded.
