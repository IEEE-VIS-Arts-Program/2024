"EchoVision" is an immersive art installation that allows participants
to experience the world of bats using sound visualization and mixed
reality technology. With a custom-designed, bat-shaped mixed reality
mask based on the open-source HoloKit mixed reality project, users can
simulate echolocation, the natural navigation system bats use in the
dark. They do this by using their voices and interpreting the returned
echoes with the mixed-reality visualization. The exhibit adjusts visual
feedback based on the pitch and tone of the user's voice, offering a
dynamic and interactive depiction of how bats perceive their
environment. This installation combines scientific learning with
empathetic engagement, encouraging an ecocentric design perspective and
understanding between species. "EchoVision" educates and inspires a
deeper appreciation for the unique ways non-human creatures interact
with their ecosystems.
