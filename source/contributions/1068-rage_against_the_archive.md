Rage Against the Archive is an artivist project comprising video,
performance, and new media art that scrutinizes how the New York Public
Library's (NYPL) digital archives catalog, display and even sell
dehumanizing ethnographic images from colonial India. This work
critically probes whether institutional archives perpetuate the cycle of
colonial trauma and the camera's violence. My conceptual approach is
anchored in a critical paradigm intended to underscore how technology
still commodifies the bodies of people of color, and how we, as a more
conscientious society, should consume certain historically traumatic
images online.

The People of India, published between 1868-75, is one of the world\'s
oldest and most comprehensive ethnographic books, commissioned by the
British colonial government in India after the 1857 First War of
Independence. After experiencing violent uprisings and the first
challenge to their colonial rule, the Britishers were keen to understand
the native tribes and their cultures to rule them better and prevent
future rebellions. The camera, masquerading as an objective device for
data collection, was employed as an imperial tool to document the
natives, "othering" them. Dehumanizing ethnographic portraits were used
as data points with an agenda to push forward a pseudo-scientific theory
about the racial, economic and cultural inferiority of Indians to
justify colonial rule. How does this problematic historical data exist
in our contemporary institutional archives? For this project, I explored
NYPL\'s online archives, which digitized the original book, providing
the public free access to these ethnographic images. However, NYPL's
website also sells these images of suffering as "Fine Art Prints" in
various options. Infusing archival practices with capitalism raises some
critical questions.

In my experimental browser-based video, I use Google Chrome\'s "Inspect
Element" feature as a glitch resistance tool to modify the underlying
HTML code of NYPL's website, inserting texts in the website that resist
the colonial ideology and question the fixity of memory present in the
archive. I also developed a Chrome browser extension that subverts
NYPL's website and replaces all the "Buy as Art Print" options with an
error message in an act of Electronic Civil Disobedience. With these
symbolic digital gestures, I hope to restore some dignity to my
ancestors, who have not only been exploited before by colonial
photographers, but whose visual representations are also being
commodified today by NYPL. In my project, I use web technologies to
challenge and disrupt entrenched power structures and propose a
decolonized digital archive where technology is harnessed to foster
respect and care. I believe that digital archives, in some cases,
instead of being harbingers of free knowledge, are just another way to
amplify the camera's violence, and they must be raged against.
