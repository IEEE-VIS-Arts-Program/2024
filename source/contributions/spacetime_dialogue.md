As advanced technology reshapes our perception, the dialogue between
humans and the universe undergoes a transformative shift. Understanding
this evolution within the vast expanse of spacetime can illuminate our
path forward. To illustrate this paradigm shift, we propose the creation
of a spatial art installation that embodies the revolution in dialogue.
Drawing on interdisciplinary research and methodologies spanning
cosmology, anthropology, philosophy, astronomy, acoustics, computer
science, and nomadic traditional singing, we embark on a transformative
journey. This work juxtaposes the most advanced astronomical observation
practices of humanity with the ancient nomadic tradition of conversing
with the cosmos using artistic language. Specifically, it engages in a
dialogue between the astronomical data from the James Webb Space
Telescope and the throat-singing tradition of Khoomei. Subsequently, the
work models the propagation of these sounds in three-dimensional space
and materializes them into tangible entities. By immersing observers in
the spatial representation of this dialogue, we offer a profound
experience of humanity's evolving relationship with the universe within
the fluidity of spacetime.
