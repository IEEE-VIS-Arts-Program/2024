Self-tracking data may be the most massive and pervasive type of data,
often in a format not usually recognized as such: photos. Digital
photography allows us to keep a record of where we have been, what we
have seen, and, most importantly, how we have felt. Photos achieve this
because they are their own visualization — organic and full of
detail — retaining impressions that we also hold in our memories. It is
through the excessive richness of images that a direct and intimate
connection to each of us is created.

When we speak of image data, we usually refer to the meta-information
(time, location) and content that can be extracted from it (what can be
objectively identified within the image), thus obscuring the organic
nature that gives it its auratic quality. Paradoxically, it is only by
considering the digital image as a technical object — a matrix of RGB
values — that its material plasticity is brought back to our awareness,
and its auratic quality is retrieved.

Mosaic Memory Drive is a puzzle of self-tracked memories. It reproduces
an image by using the pieces of another in an endless loop of re- and
de-construction. It is a series of anagrams — or anagraphs: permutations
of pixels — where an "original" data is present only as the
rearranging tiles that lend themselves to another, challenging
assumptions about the information actually stored in our data and
ourselves.

For this process to be accurately displayed, it needs to be run in
real-time, as video encryption dissolves the images' materiality to
make files lighter and their progressive decryption faster. Mosaic
Memory Drive is thus a process of encryption and decryption itself. The
technique can also be used to encode space-filling and pixel-based
visualizations into images, supporting the creation of novel data-driven
narratives.
