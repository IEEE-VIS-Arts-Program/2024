Inspired by Wagashi, the traditional Japanese confection art regarded as
a microcosm of time, space and nature, DataWagashi is a new medium
aiming to make data tangible, accessible and fun by blending taste,
smell, touch, texture, and physical interaction into the vocabulary of
data communication. By embracing a sensory upgrade from data
visualization to data physicalization, Data Wagashi turns data into an
experience that is sharable among people and accessible to those with
different sensory capabilities, making complex environmental data
approachable, foster empathy, and empower people to make better
choices.
