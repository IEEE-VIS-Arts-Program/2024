Flags of Inequality is a physical data exhibit based on the digital
project of the same name. This artwork is a collection of forty-nine
incomplete pride flags that invite the audience to reflect on the
inequalities still faced by the LGBTQ+ population of European
countries.

In this artwork, we intend to visually represent data on the struggles
still faced by the queer population in many European countries. This
collection aims to highlight the ongoing challenges related to
discrimination, legal inequalities, and social acceptance that LGBTQ+
individuals encounter daily. Through art and a familiar symbol, the
visual representation of this data helps empathize and raise awareness.
