In the face of pressing global issues like climate change, data
visualization is a powerful tool for making sense of complexity. With
the project "A Perfect Storm", we aim to engage audiences in the
oft-difficult conversation around global climate change in a way that
considers the emotional responses that the topic can trigger. Through a
metaphorical approach of visually juxtaposing countries' climate risk
with their climate responsibility, we encourage critical reflection on
the human experience and inequities of climate change related loss.
