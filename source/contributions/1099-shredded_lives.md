This pictorial illustrates an autoethnographic exploration of my design
practice for the data physicalization "Shredded Lives: A Decade of
Migrant Loss". It emphasizes the parallel development of seven design
components â€” Interaction Mode, Technology, Data Representation,
Physical Configuration & Scale, Dataset, Engagement Mode, and Spatial
Experience. This flexible, non-hierarchical approach allows each
component to inform and evolve alongside the others, stemming from a
desire to thoroughly explore the design space without confinement by
initial restrictions. As these components overlap and intersect, dynamic
interactions occur, leading to the manifestation of design ideas.
