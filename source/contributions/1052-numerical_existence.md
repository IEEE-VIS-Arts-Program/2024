Data visualization is often associated with efficiency and the
production of insights. However, nonconventional visual works with data,
particularly artistic visualizations, are less frequently discussed,
despite some notable exceptions. Artistic visualization is typically
presented and debated at conferences on data visualization and related
areas in computing and design, usually involving an exhibition of works
in parallel. While there are established exhibitions in electronic art,
collective exhibitions focused on artistic data visualization,
especially those independent of academic events, remain rare.
Additionally, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the
curation of artistic data visualization exhibitions, whether in physical
or online environments. This article addresses this gap by exploring the
curatorial processes behind two artistic data visualization exhibitions,
"Numerical Existence" and "Numerical Existence: Emergencies," held
in Rio de Janeiro in 2018 and 2024, respectively. We will present an
overview of artistic data visualization exhibitions, discuss the role
and unique challenges of curation in this field, and share detailed
insights from our curatorial experience with the two exhibitions.
Furthermore, we will propose future directions for research and practice
in the curation of artistic data visualization. Through this
exploration, we aim to contribute to the practice of curating artistic
data visualization, providing reflections and recommendations to enhance
the development and appreciation of this emerging field.
