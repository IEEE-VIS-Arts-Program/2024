With armed conflicts and wars continuing to occur globally, peace has
been an enduring and crucial concern. In the efforts to resolve these
conflicts, a vast number of peace agreements have been signed. In this
project, we examine the extent to which women and gender are explicitly
acknowledged or addressed in peace agreements. Using debossing, we
physicalize the mentions of women and gender in these agreements as a
means to increase awareness and recognition of these suffered but
often-overlooked crowds.
