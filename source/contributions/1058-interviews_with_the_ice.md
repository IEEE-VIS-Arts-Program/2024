"Interviews with the Ice", an art science collaboration is an
installation made up of five columns, each representing a point in time
where scientists have made leaps in understanding about Greenland\'s
geologic history, ice coverage and melt rates. Methods have included
marine sediment samples, seismic data of Greenland's continental shelf,
the drilling of ice cores, ice-penetrating radar and satellites. Each of
these datatypes have particular textures and have been used to reconstruct
particular ice geometries, bedrock sediment formations, and documentation of
Greenland\'s ice coverage through the millennia. Bring the scientific
methods and data of this far off region into our physical environment,
the work is mixed media combining wall constructions and bowls of glass
and clay documenting Greenland's ice sheet changes.
