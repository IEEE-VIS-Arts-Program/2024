One of the pressing consequences of carbon-fueled climate change is its
direct link to causing various forms of natural disasters. These
disasters range from wildfires, and floods, to tsunamis and earthquakes.
In the fallout of these disasters many people become displaced from
their homes. By the year 2050 it is estimated that 140 million people
will be displaced from their home countries of sub-Saharan Africa, South
Asia, and Latin America due to these disasters (World Bank). As a
result, it is of increasing importance to address the impacts of climate
change and not only the effects on the environment, but also on the
world's inhabitants.

This visualization was created in order to showcase the impact of
natural disasters and the need for climate reform globally in an
aesthetically beautiful, and interpretable, way.
