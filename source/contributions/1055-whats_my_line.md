Data is moving beyond the scientific community, flooding communication
channels and addressing issues of importance to all aspects of daily
life. This highlights the need for rich and expressive data
representations to communicate the science on which society rests and on
which society must act. However, current visualization techniques often
lack the broad visual vocabulary needed to accommodate the explosion in
data scale, diversity and audience perspectives.
While previous work has mined artistic and design knowledge for colour
maps and shape affordances (glyphs) in visualization, line encoding has
received little attention. In this paper we report on an exploration of
visual properties that extend the vocabulary of the line, particularly
for categorical encoding. We describe the creation of a corpus of lines
motivated by artistic practice, gestalt theory and design principles and
present initial results from a study of how different visual properties
influence how people associate these into sets of similar lines. While
very preliminary, the findings suggest a rich set of line visual
features to support both association and categorical hierarchies, and
provoke further inquiry into how and why line encoding can be more
expressive encoding multivariate, multidimensional data.
