Abstract: Curbside is a personal exploration of (dis)ability and
(im)mobility in wintertime Calgary. I use textiles, texts, and
photographs to weave together self and the environment. Curbside
connects quantitative data about snow and temperature with traces of
environmental conditions using dyed yarns and photographs. Interlaced
throughout are theoretically grounded autobiographical reflections about
disability. These reflections focus on how landscape forms and interacts
with disability in ways that are informed by water, snow, and ice. It
embodies how different forms of data such as quantitative weather data,
material traces, and personal stories can work together. Curbside also
provides an example of how data art can incorporate highly personal
experience to illuminate local systems in thoughtful ways.
