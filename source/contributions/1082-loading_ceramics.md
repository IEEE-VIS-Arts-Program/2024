This article introduces an artistic research project that utilises
artist-in-residency and exhibition as methods for exploring the
possibilities of robotic 3D printing and ceramics. The interdisciplinary
project unites artists and architects to collaborate on a proposed
curatorial concept and Do-It-With-Others (DIWO) technological
development. Constraints include material, specifically local clay,
production technique, namely 3D printing with a robotic arm, and kiln
size, as well as an exhibition concept that is further elaborated in the
next chapter. The pictorial presents four projects as case studies
demonstrating how the creatives integrate these constraints into their
processes. This integration leads to the subsequent refinement and
customization of the robotic-ceramics interface, aligning with the
practitioners\' requirements through software development. The
project\'s focus extends beyond artistic outcomes, aiming also to
advance the pipeline of 3D robotic printing in clay, employing a
digitally controlled material press that has been developed in-house,
with its functionality refined through practice.
