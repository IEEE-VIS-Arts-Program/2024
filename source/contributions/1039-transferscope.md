Transferscope is an interactive installation that lets users explore and
reflect the implications of generative artificial intelligence on our
perception of the physical world. The handheld device allows users to
sample materials and concepts and aesthetics and seamlessly project and
apply them onto any object or scene, thereby creating imaginative and
unique visual experiences.

The artifact offers a unique perspective on the role of data in artistic
creation, and invites visitors to critically reflect the aesthetic
character of state-of-the-art image generation algorithms, emphasizing
the importance of diversity in data sources (to train the models) and
outputs. It demonstrates how AI can serve as a collaborator in the
artistic process, enhancing human creativity while making tangible new
insights into the nature of visual data. This installation facilitates
also reflecting on the ethical and cultural implications of data set
curation for the aesthetic characteristics of current generative AI
models.
