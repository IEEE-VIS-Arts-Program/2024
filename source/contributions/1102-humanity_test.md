Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly prevalent in
everyday life and across various sectors, notably intelligent
assistants, healthcare, and education. In the realm of human-computer
interaction, AI interactive systems aim to foster connections and
understanding among users further, deepening the communication between
humans and machines as well as among multiple individuals. However, this
paper highlights that current studies have neglected the media and
philosophical dimensions, culminating in an interactive system named the
'Humanity Test.' "Humanity" refers to emotions and consciousness,
while "test" signifies a critical study of AI technology and an
exploration of the distinctions between humanity and technicality.
Furthermore, based on a review of related literature, we argue that the
focus of AI system research is shifting, with electroencephalogram (EEG)
data becoming a trend in AI system integration. Collecting and analyzing
experimental data, we identified three design directions: enhancing
immersive experiences, creating emotional experiences, and expressing
ideas. The experiment results indicate that integrating EEG data into AI
systems markedly improves participants' immersive and emotional
experiences. This integration not only promotes a deeper understanding
of the human-machine boundary but also encourages empathic interactions
among users. Based on these findings, EEG data as a medium shows a
promising potential to enrich interactive experiences, providing new
insights into integrating technology with human emotions.
