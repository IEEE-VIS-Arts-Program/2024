In the video series 'Biological Rhythms', electrical signals generated
by plants are sonified and captured to drive real-time data visualisations. 
From this live data, we will create a series of eight video pieces (see 
links to draft versions of the first four in 'Recent work, video links' 
section below). Living plants and the human body may appear to be very 
different entities, but they have many underlying confluences. Once such
confluence is that both generate bio-electrical signals that pass
through bodily systems. In 'Biological Rhythms' we will use these
signals to generate real time visualisations, revealing the unseen
bioelectrical rhythms of plants. Through the biological sciences, we
understand plant meta- processes such as osmosis and photosynthesis, yet
because their cellular structure is so delicate, plants are notoriously
hard to study in fine detail. Sonifying plant signals affords a method
to explore their bio-rhythms in an accessible form for a non-scientific
audience. As part of our bespoke and innovative method, the electrical
signals from plants are converted to audio and passed through the
program Touch Designer, where the plant signals activate complex
geometrical forms. Simon Howden composes 'human' music which is mixed
live with the plant signals, allowing us to explore co-creation with
living plants as a posthuman mode of artistic research.
