Collaborative art and co-creation enhance social well-being and
connectivity. However, the combination of art creation through mutual
brainwave interaction with the prosocial potential of EEG biosignals
reveals an untapped opportunity. SynCocreate presents the design and
prototype of a VR-based interpersonal electroencephalography (EEG)
neurofeedback co-creation platform. This generative VR platform enables
paired individuals to interact via brainwaves in a 3D virtual canvas,
painted and animated collaboratively through their real-time brainwave
data. The platform employs synchronized visual cues, aligned with the
real-time brainwaves of paired users, to investigate the potential of
collaborative neurofeedback in enhancing co-creativity and emotional
connection. It also explores the use of Virtual Reality (VR) in
fostering creativity and togetherness through immersive, collective
visualizations of brainwaves.
