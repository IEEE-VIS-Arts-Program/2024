"Northness" is an installation that maps the latitudes of the servers
that host the most popular websites in Brazil. Composed of
three-dimensional typographic sculptures, a touch screen and projection,
the work allows the public to visualize and locate the servers of the
one hundred most accessed websites in Brazil. This installation is part
of research in artistic data visualization that addresses issues of the
data infrastructure sustaining our society, highlighting the Global
North's dominance in data flows. "Northness" was featured in the
exhibition "Numerical Existence: Emergencies," which took place in 2024
at the Futuros Cultural Center in Brazil.
