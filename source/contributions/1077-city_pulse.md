Metro systems are the pulsing veins of cities, traversing the city's
texture and preserving the memory of urban life. Visualizing invisible
urban metro landscape makes each city's unique identity and development
more emblematic. In this project, we introduce an abstraction method
that encodes metro routes as lines, cities as squares, and the global
map as an abstract representation. Along with the implementation of an
interactive system, the project enables a comprehensive visual
exploration of the global metro lines. Through this highly abstract and
minimalist form, each city's structure, symbolic identity, and regional
development are revealed. Moreover, the colorful global metro map
efficiently portrays the diversity and evolution of metro lines
worldwide. With this pictorial we narrate the design process and our
reflections along the project.
