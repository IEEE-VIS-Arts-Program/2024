Our work builds on the study of notational systems and poetry lyrics in
the context of rap music and offers rich insights into the complexities
of language, culture, and expression in a postcolonial culture. We have
created three platforms that combine to make up one installation. 1) A
screen-based interactive visualization system that demonstrates the
encodings as you listen to the song, with filtering and scrubbing
capabilities, 2) the physical rap tapestry weaving to be exhibited on a
large wall surface and 3) a series of individual prints of the
instrumental breakdown printed into small books or 'zines'.
