## Paper Submission

We invite researchers, scholars, and creative practitioners to submit
papers related to the theme *Perpetual Presence*. Submissions can
include, but are not limited to technical descriptions of creative
visualization projects and techniques, reflections on the impact of data
visualization techniques on art and design practice, philosophical
meditations on art-science methodology, expanded descriptions and
discussions of specific (media) art projects (including design case
studies), and critical interpretations of visualization approaches and
practices. We are open to any submission that relates in some way to art
or design and to this year's theme (see [[Call for
Entries]{.underline}](https://visap.net/2023/call-for-entries)).

#### Paper Format

Authors are required to use the [[IEEE Conference
format]{.underline}](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/) for
paper
submissions. [[Word]{.underline}](https://www.cspaul.com/vgtc/vgtc_conference_word.zip) and [[LaTeX]{.underline}](https://www.cspaul.com/vgtc/vgtc_conference_latex.zip) templates
are available. It is mandatory to use this format. However, including
keywords and index terms is optional.

Paper submissions must not exceed 10 pages---including all figures and
references.

Submitting supplementary material and/or links to external materials is
encouraged to help reviewers evaluate the submission.

#### Acceptance

Accepted authors will present their work in-person in one of the two
VISAP Papers sessions during the conference. All accepted papers will be
published online in the IEEE VIS 2023 Arts Program proceedings, and
indexed in the IEEE Xplore digital library.

#### Previous VISAP Papers

## Pictorial Submission

We invite artists and designers to submit pictorials and annotated
portfolios related to the theme *Perpetual Presence*. Artists,
designers, and researchers all make creative choices based on practical
knowledge, generally acquired through experience. Unfortunately, this
knowledge is seldom shared in publications. VISAP Pictorials aim to
foster discussions about this reflection-in-action when creating
visualizations or data-driven art pieces.

Pictorial submissions reflect either on shared concepts among a
selection of visualizations, or on the design process of a single work.
Whether in the case of a single artifact, or, in the case of a series of
artifacts, the designer is in a unique position to provide valuable
insights into the design intentions, the design space explorations, and
the design process (Löwgren 2013). Through pictorials and annotated
portfolios, we invite submissions that communicate the visualization
practices in rich, heavily visual ways.

### What to Consider

Elements that reviewers will look for include:

-   The quality of the description of the design process and reflections
    on this process
-   The appropriateness and richness of the visual style
-   The quality of presentation
-   The production value of images, photos and diagrams

#### What is A Pictorial/Annotated Portfolio?

A pictorial is a visual description and reflection of the design process
of a single visualization project. It is intended to capture the
situated and rich nature of design. See DIS Pictorials for inspiration.

An annotated portfolio is a collection of design works with brief
textual annotations. It has been proposed by Gaver and Bowers (2012) as
a "way to communicate design research". The systematic selection and
annotation of the artifacts are part of the contribution. Submitters are
encouraged to highlight important features, discuss how ideas were
developed, and reflect on recurring topics through their series of
works.

#### Pictorial Format

Artists and designers are required to use the VISAP Pictorials format
for pictorial and annotated portfolio
submissions. [[InDesign]{.underline}](https://visap.net/2023/VISAP_pictorial_Indd.zip) and [[Word]{.underline}](https://visap.net/2023/VISAP_pictorial_Word.zip) templates
are available. It is mandatory to use this format.

Pictorials and annotated portfolios must not exceed 16 pages. We
encourage submitters to use the space in the most creative and visual
way.

Submitting supplementary material and/or links to external material is
encouraged to help reviewers evaluate the submission.

## Artwork Submission

We invite artists and designers to submit data-driven artworks related
to the theme Perpetual Presence. We welcome submissions in any medium,
e.g., interactive projections, multimedia sculptures, mobile devices,
illustrations, physicalizations, video game art, digital prints,
screen-based art, fixed audio-visual pieces, etc.

#### What to Include in Your Proposal

While the proposal is free-form, the following information must be
included (consider structuring your proposal based on these headings):

1.  **General Information**: Title of the work, Year, Authors (and roles), Medium and Dimensions of the work
2.  **Description**: Description of the work and any interactive elements. Explain how your work relates to this year's theme and how it links to information visualization, scientific visualization, and/or visual analytics. Discuss the reception of your work at previous exhibitions (if it has been exhibited before)
3.  **Technical Requirements**: Given that VISAP' 23 is an in-person event, describe how the work will be presented at the gallery space. Provide technical details of the project. For example, what technical equipment is required? Does the project require the audience to interact with it live? Are there any time of day requirements or specific lighting conditions needed? Does it require any specific space or technical setup (e.g. VR gadgets or audiovisual equipment)? Consider how your artwork could be integrated in both a physical and virtual art exhibition.
4.  **Supporting Material**: Provide links to high-resolution images, audio, webpages and/or videos that will help give the reviewers a clear sense of your work

Artworks could involve any of the following forms:

-   Visualization that emphasizes visual and performative aesthetics
-   Visualization that encourages creative and/or collaborative
    interactions
-   Speculative visualizations
-   Visualization as tactical media
-   New data paradigms
-   Live coding and streaming data
-   Complex systems
-   Exploratory data semantics
-   3D visualization, VR/AR/XR environments, and immersive analytics
-   Computational photography
-   Ambient information displays
-   Visualization as storytelling
-   Design studies
-   Data sonification
-   Conversation theory
-   Digital humanities visualization
-   Physical visualization and sculptural design

**SUBMISSION FORMAT (EXHIBITION)**

Artists and designers are required to submit a 2 page .pdf file
describing the work they wish to exhibit. No specific format is imposed.

Submitting additional images, videos, or audio files as supplementary
material is strongly encouraged to help reviewers evaluate the
submission.

**ACCEPTANCE**

All accepted artworks will be included in the online proceedings of
VISAP on the [[visap.net]{.underline}](https://visap.net/2023/) website,
as well as in a VISAP 2023 catalog that will be shared on the VISAP
website. All accepted artworks will be presented in the gallery space of
the [[Library at the
Docs]{.underline}](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/community/hubs-bookable-spaces/the-dock/library-at-the-dock/Pages/library-at-the-dock.aspx)from
October 2 to October 29, 2023. This means that, in contrast to previous
years, the VISAP exhibition will be open prior to the conference, and
remain open for almost one month.

The official opening of the exhibition will take place during the week
of the VIS conference (presumably Tuesday, October 24, 2023. Some
artworks may be selected for artist talks during the week of the IEEE
VIS conference. Performance submissions may also be scheduled for
specific times during the exhibition. Artists will work with the VISAP
organizers on the details for showcasing their artworks. Artists and
authors are strongly encouraged to participate in the VISAP program
throughout the week.

No artist fees or travel costs are provided. There are some
complimentary registrations available for selected artists. Priority
will be given to exhibiting artists who are independent artists and not
affiliated with institutions.

The VISAP 2023 exhibition chairs will contact the exhibitors upon
acceptance.
